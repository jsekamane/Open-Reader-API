# Open Reader API

This is the repo for the **[Open Reader API](http://rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API/)** and is built with [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/).

## Making Contributions

Making contributions or changes is easy. Clone this repo, alter the content within the content folder and submit a pull request.

All content is created in plain text using the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. The folder structure will define the end url path structure so keep that in mind if new files and folders are added.

The final display on http://rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API is updated as needed manually using nanoc.

## Testing Your Changes

**Note:** Simply changing the Markdown files within `/content` is enough to make contributions or changes to this repo. The following is only for testing.

If you want to test out your changes to ensure the final generation is correct, you can install the `nanoc` gem and `kramdown` gem which is used for Markdown formatting.

view available nanoc commands with:

    nanoc -h

Nanoc compiles the site into static files within the `output` folder. Run the compile with:

    nanoc compile

You can use MAMP or a similar setup to view the resulting files or you can install the `adsf` gem which will work with nanoc. Then you can use:

    nanoc view
    open http://localhost:3000

## Updating the live site

The [live site](http://rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API/) lives in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/rss-sync/Open-Reader-API/tree/gh-pages). To update the live site, update master locally and run `nanoc compile`. The latest generated output will be in `/output/Open-Reader-API/`.

In order to update the live content, check out the gh-pages branch in a separate directory, remove the files and copy all of the generated files over. Commit changes and push to complete the update.
